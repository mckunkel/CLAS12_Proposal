\section{Beam Time Request}\label{sec:beamrequest}
With this proposal and beam time request, we ask to run for 80 days parallel with the beam time already approved for Run-group A. The 80 days will be dedicated to the production beam time with the standard CLAS setup, at full luminosity ($\sim 10^{35} \mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$) with 75\% - 100\% torus field. This request should provide a competitive data sample of $\etaP \to \epem \gamma$. The CLAS12 configuration we propose for the measurement of the transition form factors is compatible with the experimental setup already established by Run Group A.
