	From Fig.~\ref{fig:counts} the QED normalized spectrum can be deduced and is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}. Both acceptance models (i.e. flat and QED+VMD) are used to determine the transition form factor. It is shown that there exists a systematic uncertainty depending on the chosen acceptance model. However, the final calculation on the slope parameter or the TFF shows a negligible impact of this uncertainty. Regardless of the acceptance model, it is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results} that the accumulated statistics collected by CLAS12 allow for a precision of each parameter $\lesssim 0.5\%$. Compared to current experimental results of 10\% and with similar differences in theoretical approaches of $\approx$ 10\%~\ref{tab:theory} a measurement by CLAS12 would not only confirm...
